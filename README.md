# How to create a repo using SSH

This repo is created using ssh key.

- As a part of my Github refresher course, I created this.
- A repository is created in local repository
- Generated an SSH Key and then added this to the github SSh keys.
- Now since this exists, I wouldn't need credentials to commit
- Now, when I pushed my code, I didn't require my github credentials.

## Voila! now you can do this too.
